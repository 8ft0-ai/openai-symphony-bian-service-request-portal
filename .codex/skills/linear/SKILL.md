# Linear GraphQL

Use this skill for raw Linear GraphQL work during Symphony app-server sessions.

## Primary tool

Use the `linear_graphql` client tool exposed by Symphony's app-server session.
It reuses Symphony's configured Linear auth for the session.

Tool input:

```json
{
  "query": "query or mutation document",
  "variables": {
    "optional": "graphql variables object"
  }
}
```

Tool behavior:

- Send one GraphQL operation per tool call.
- Treat a top-level `errors` array as a failed GraphQL operation even if the
  tool call itself completed.
- Keep queries/mutations narrowly scoped; ask only for the fields you need.

## Discovering unfamiliar operations

When you need an unfamiliar mutation, input type, or object field, use targeted
introspection through `linear_graphql`.

List mutation names:

```graphql
query ListMutations {
  __type(name: "Mutation") {
    fields {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Inspect a specific input object:

```graphql
query CommentCreateInputShape {
  __type(name: "CommentCreateInput") {
    inputFields {
      name
      type {
        kind
        name
        ofType {
          kind
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Common workflows

### Post QA evidence to Linear

Use this workflow whenever a ticket requires screenshots, videos, logs, or other
artifacts to be posted in the Linear workpad.

Rules:

- Do not treat local-only paths such as `artifacts/foo.png` or
  `/Users/name/Desktop/foo.png` as posted evidence.
- Do not mark acceptance evidence complete until the artifact is openable from
  the Linear comment itself.
- Prefer pasted excerpts for short text evidence (command output, short logs,
  Playwright notes) instead of uploading a separate text file.
- Prefer file upload for screenshots, videos, and longer files that are awkward
  to paste inline.

Workflow:

1. Upload the local file with `fileUpload`.
2. PUT the bytes to the signed `uploadUrl` with the exact returned headers.
3. Edit the workpad comment and replace the local path placeholder with the
   resulting `assetUrl`, or embed the media directly in markdown.
4. Re-read the comment and verify the artifact URL appears in the final body.

Evidence completion gate:

- `Acceptance Evidence` entries must point to a Linear asset URL, PR media URL,
  check-run URL, or a clearly named pasted excerpt location.
- Workpad examples do not count as evidence by themselves.
- If the workpad only contains examples/templates, the evidence step is still
  incomplete.

### Query an issue by key, identifier, or id

Use these progressively:

- Start with `issue(id: $key)` when you have a ticket key such as `MT-686`.
- Fall back to `issues(filter: ...)` when you need identifier search semantics.
- Once you have the internal issue id, prefer `issue(id: $id)` for narrower reads.

Lookup by issue key:

```graphql
query IssueByKey($key: String!) {
  issue(id: $key) {
    id
    identifier
    title
    state {
      id
      name
      type
    }
    project {
      id
      name
    }
    branchName
    url
    description
    updatedAt
    links {
      nodes {
        id
        url
        title
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Lookup by identifier filter:

```graphql
query IssueByIdentifier($identifier: String!) {
  issues(filter: { identifier: { eq: $identifier } }, first: 1) {
    nodes {
      id
      identifier
      title
      state {
        id
        name
        type
      }
      project {
        id
        name
      }
      branchName
      url
      description
      updatedAt
    }
  }
}
```

Resolve a key to an internal id:

```graphql
query IssueByIdOrKey($id: String!) {
  issue(id: $id) {
    id
    identifier
    title
  }
}
```

Read the issue once the internal id is known:

```graphql
query IssueDetails($id: String!) {
  issue(id: $id) {
    id
    identifier
    title
    url
    description
    state {
      id
      name
      type
    }
    project {
      id
      name
    }
    attachments {
      nodes {
        id
        title
        url
        sourceType
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Query team workflow states for an issue

Use this before changing issue state when you need the exact `stateId`:

```graphql
query IssueTeamStates($id: String!) {
  issue(id: $id) {
    id
    team {
      id
      key
      name
      states {
        nodes {
          id
          name
          type
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Edit an existing comment

Use `commentUpdate` through `linear_graphql`:

```graphql
mutation UpdateComment($id: String!, $body: String!) {
  commentUpdate(id: $id, input: { body: $body }) {
    success
    comment {
      id
      body
    }
  }
}
```

### Create a comment

Use `commentCreate` through `linear_graphql`:

```graphql
mutation CreateComment($issueId: String!, $body: String!) {
  commentCreate(input: { issueId: $issueId, body: $body }) {
    success
    comment {
      id
      url
    }
  }
}
```

### Move an issue to a different state

Use `issueUpdate` with the destination `stateId`:

```graphql
mutation MoveIssueToState($id: String!, $stateId: String!) {
  issueUpdate(id: $id, input: { stateId: $stateId }) {
    success
    issue {
      id
      identifier
      state {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Attach a GitHub PR to an issue

Use the GitHub-specific attachment mutation when linking a PR:

```graphql
mutation AttachGitHubPR($issueId: String!, $url: String!, $title: String) {
  attachmentLinkGitHubPR(
    issueId: $issueId
    url: $url
    title: $title
    linkKind: links
  ) {
    success
    attachment {
      id
      title
      url
    }
  }
}
```

If you only need a plain URL attachment and do not care about GitHub-specific
link metadata, use:

```graphql
mutation AttachURL($issueId: String!, $url: String!, $title: String) {
  attachmentLinkURL(issueId: $issueId, url: $url, title: $title) {
    success
    attachment {
      id
      title
      url
    }
  }
}
```

### Introspection patterns used during schema discovery

Use these when the exact field or mutation shape is unclear:

```graphql
query QueryFields {
  __type(name: "Query") {
    fields {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql
query IssueFieldArgs {
  __type(name: "Query") {
    fields {
      name
      args {
        name
        type {
          kind
          name
          ofType {
            kind
            name
            ofType {
              kind
              name
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Upload a video to a comment

Do this in three steps:

1. Call `linear_graphql` with `fileUpload` to get `uploadUrl`, `assetUrl`, and
   any required upload headers.
2. Upload the local file bytes to `uploadUrl` with `curl -X PUT` and the exact
   headers returned by `fileUpload`.
3. Call `linear_graphql` again with `commentCreate` (or `commentUpdate`) and
   include the resulting `assetUrl` in the comment body. For screenshots and
   other images, embed the file inline with markdown image syntax.

Useful mutations:

```graphql
mutation FileUpload(
  $filename: String!
  $contentType: String!
  $size: Int!
  $makePublic: Boolean
) {
  fileUpload(
    filename: $filename
    contentType: $contentType
    size: $size
    makePublic: $makePublic
  ) {
    success
    uploadFile {
      uploadUrl
      assetUrl
      headers {
        key
        value
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Upload any artifact and attach it to a workpad comment

Use this sequence for screenshots, videos, markdown files, or logs that should
be accessible from the Linear workpad:

1. Query `fileUpload` with the local filename, content type, and byte size.
2. Upload the local file to the returned `uploadUrl` with `curl -X PUT` and the
   exact response headers.
3. Update the target comment body so the evidence entry uses the returned
   `assetUrl` instead of a local path.
   - For screenshot/image evidence, also embed `![descriptive alt text](<assetUrl>)`
     directly in the workpad comment so the image is visibly rendered inline.
4. Query the comment again and confirm the body now contains the `assetUrl`.
5. For screenshot/image evidence, confirm the comment body contains the markdown
   image embed, not just a bare URL.

Good workpad evidence entries:

- `Artifact: https://uploads.linear.app/...`
- `Artifact: pasted npm test output under Validation note 2026-03-23 18:31 AEDT`
- `![Greeting page showing Hello, Alice](https://uploads.linear.app/...)`

Bad workpad evidence entries:

- `Artifact: artifacts/exr-9-greeting-page.png`
- `Artifact: /tmp/playwright-output.txt`
- `https://uploads.linear.app/...` as a bare screenshot URL with no inline image embed

## Usage rules

- Use `linear_graphql` for comment edits, uploads, and ad-hoc Linear API
  queries.
- Prefer the narrowest issue lookup that matches what you already know:
  key -> identifier search -> internal id.
- For state transitions, fetch team states first and use the exact `stateId`
  instead of hardcoding names inside mutations.
- Prefer `attachmentLinkGitHubPR` over a generic URL attachment when linking a
  GitHub PR to a Linear issue.
- Do not introduce new raw-token shell helpers for GraphQL access.
- If you need shell work for uploads, only use it for signed upload URLs
  returned by `fileUpload`; those URLs already carry the needed authorization.
